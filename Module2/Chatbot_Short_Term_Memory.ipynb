        "In trial A the bot acknowledged the code that I gave it, but then in trial C acted as if I never told it that original code. This is because of the amount of memory I have alloted the bot to have while running these prompts. The bot is only able to remember the last 2 prompts within the chat history, once you are past that limit the bot will completely forget what you said previously.\n",

        "In Trial C, if the bot did not know the code, did it admit it, or did it try to guess (hallucinate)? Explain what happens when a chatbot has a window that is too small.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bot did not admit it. It instead hallucinated and tried to play it off by turning it into another joke. When the window is too small the bot wants to give you a repsonse that fits with your question so it tries its best in order to do that despite the fact that it cannot remember what you previously told it.\n",

        "The system message is the tone or persona of the bot, it sounds a solid guideline for how the bot should respond to any prompt it is given. If you were to remove the system message of this bot, it would no longer repsond with jokes and would only give you the answer to your question.\n",

        "After doing the experiment again with a window of 6 messages, the bot was able to remember the vault code this time. This is because the prompt that provided the code was still within the memory window of when I asked the bot to tell me the code again."
