Did your model repeat any words or phrases?
Yes on trial A it just repeated the same phrase.
Did the model use real words, or did it start outputting random characters and punctuation? Explain how the "Probability Distribution" changed to allow this.
For the most part the model did well with this. The only case of real randomness was the use ")" that appeared on line 53 in trial C. The appearance of the ")" is because of the change in the temperature. With the temperature cranked up to 2.0 the model's softmax function starts to make all of its known vocab more and more likely to be used to generate text regardless of the context of the prompt.
If you were building a medical AI to give prescriptions or advice, which temperature would you use?
I would use a temperature that is closer to the 0.8 trial run. Considering that it still used some creativity I may be interested in going slightly lower than the 0.8 temperature to ensure that the model is as accurate as possible.
If you were building an AI to write a surrealist dream-journal, which would you use?
I would use a temperature around 1.5 to make sure that the model is able to create grammatically correct sentences but still be creative enough to make an interesting story.
